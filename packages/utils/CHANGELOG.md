### Minor Changes

- ed7e31e: Fix type narrowing when using equality test on unist visitor

  This may break some scenarios where equality test is used inline for a generic property of a Node:

  ```ts
  visitParents({
    tree,
    // This previously was inferred as `{value: string}`, now it is inferred as `{value: 'foo'}`
    // which will narrow down the Node type to `never` if none of the Node types have `'foo'` as a type literal
    test: {
      value: 'foo',
    },
  });

  visitParents({
    tree,
    // To return the previous behavior while still using an inline constant, add the non-literal type within <> before the value
    // to declare it shouldn't be const-inferred.
    test: {
      value: <string>'foo',
    },
  });
  ```
