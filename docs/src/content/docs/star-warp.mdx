description: Warp-drive search for Astro sites using Pagefind
packageName: '@inox-tools/star-warp'
---

This integration adds a quick "jump to first search result" URL to any Astro site using Pagefind. With that, your users can search within your website from their browsers search bar directly.

Inspired by HiDeoo's [Starlight Jump To](https://sjt.vercel.app/) and Astro's [Wormhole](https://a.stro.cc/).

## Installing the integration

import InstallCmd from '@/components/InstallCmd.astro';

<InstallCmd />

## How to use

With the integration installed, navigating to `<your site>/warp?q=your search term` will navigate to the first result of that search.

For example, go to https://inox-tools.fryuni.dev/warp?q=logger and see where you land :)

This works completely statically, you don't need SSR to use this integration.

## Using with Starlight

This integration is also a Starlight plugin! Using it as such enables better defaults inferred from your Starlight config.

Just move it from the `integrations` property on your `astro.config.mjs` to the `plugins` property in side the Starlight integration:

```ts title="astro.config.mjs" del={9} ins={7}
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
import starWarp from '@inox-tools/star-warp';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			plugins: [starWarp()],
		}),
		starWarp(),
	],
});
```

## OpenSearch

:::tip
When using this integration as a Starlight plugin, OpenSearch is enabled and configured automatically by default.
:::

You can enable the generation of an OpenSearch Description with the following configuration:

```ts title="astro.config.mjs" ins={6-8}
import starWarp from '@inox-tools/star-warp';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starWarp({
			openSearch: {
				enabled: true,
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

With OpenSearch enabled, add the following to the `<head>` block of your pages:

```html ins={2-7}
<head>
	<link
		rel="search"
		type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
		href="/warp.xml"
		title="Astro Site"
	/>
</head>
```

The `href` property is defined by your project's [`base`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) and OpenSearch [`path` parameter](#path). The `title` property can be anything you want, it will be used by the browser when displaying the search bar.

### Using on browsers

#### Chrome

Chrome will automatically load the OpenSearch Description once you navigate to any page with the link tag, but it will keep it deactivated. To enable it:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Go to the [Chrome Settings Search Engine](chrome://settings/searchEngines) page.

2. Search for your site under "Inactive shortcuts".

3. Click on the "Activate" button.

</Steps>

Once activated, typing anything after the domain will switch the Omnibox to searching on your website:

![chrome-omnibox](../../img/site-warp-chrome-2.png)

#### Safari

Safari will automatically load the OpenSearch Description once you navigate to any page with the link tag. From then on, you'll see an option to search the site when typing anything after the site:
