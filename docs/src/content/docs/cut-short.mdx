description: Interrupt rendering a request and send a custom response while keeping your code organized.
---

Cut-short is an Astro integration that lets you stop processing a request instantly and send back a custom response, simplifying control flow in your Astro applications. By introducing the `endRequest` function, it eliminates the need for cumbersome workarounds like bubbling up response objects, throwing and catching sentinel errors, implementing custom middleware logic or replicating error response logic across all your pages.

Keep the the custom response for specific conditions close to the conditions and have it shared across all your application. It's especially useful for scenarios like user authentication and access control, where you might need to redirect users to sign-in page from anywhere that requires authentication or to turn any page they don't have access to into a 404 to avoid information leak (like GitHub does).

## Installing the integration

import InstallCmd from '@/components/InstallCmd.astro';

<InstallCmd />

## How to use

From any code that is reachable from a page rendering context can use the `endRequest` function to stop the rendering process and immediately return a web-standard `Response` for the ongoing request.

A page-rendering context is when you are inside of:

- A middleware;
- The frontmatter of a page component (not components _in_ the page, see [streaming](#streaming));
- An API endpoint;
- A function called from another page-rendering context.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Common module">

```ts title="src/lib/auth.js"
import { endRequest } from '@it-astro/cut-short';

export function getUser() {
  if (noUser) endRequest(new Response('No user', { status: 401 }));

  return {...};
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Page or Component">

```astro title="src/pages/dashboard.astro"
---
import { getUser } from '../lib/auth';

// Calling a function from a rendering context allows it to stop the request.
const user = getUser();
---

<Dashboard />
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Endpoint">

```ts title="src/pages/userId.ts"
import { endRequest } from '@it-astro/cut-short';
import { getUser } from '../lib/auth';

export const GET = () => {
	if (someCondition) endRequest(new Response('Matched inline blocking condition'));

	// Calling a function from a rendering context allows it to stop the request.
	const user = getUser();

	return new Response(user.id);
};
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Pre-rendering

On static sites or pre-rendered pages for hybrid sites, the `endRequest` function can be used to set the content of the pre-rendered file that will be generated. This will change the _static_ file, so the same content will be served for every request to that page.

Additionally, while prerendering, you can also call the `cancelPrerender` function to skip the currently rendering page/route. In that case, the static file won't be present in the final output of your build and requests to that path will be handled by the hosting platform however it handles non-static paths (for most platforms, that will be calling the Astro server, but on fully static sites it might show a static 404 page).

## Reference

### `endRequest()`

**Type:** `(withResponse: Response | (() => Response | Promise<Response>)) => void`

Stop the current request and send back a custom response.

The argument can be a `Response` object to be used directly or a function that returns a `Response` object or a promise that resolves to a `Response`.

### `cancelPrerender()`

**Type:** `() => void`

Stop the current rendering page and mark it such that there is no rendered file on the final output.

Calling this on the server will cause an internal server error.

## Options

### `disableStreaming`

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Default:** `false`

Disables [HTML streaming](#streaming), lifting its limitations. 

## Streaming

Astro serves all server-rendered pages using [HTML streaming], which brings improved performance for users by allowing the page to start rendering earlier while parts of the page still being generated on the server. You can lean even more on streaming by passing promises around to components and into the final templates instead of awaiting them on the frontmatter, as shown on Astro's [streaming guide].

[HTML streaming]: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#html-streaming
[streaming guide]: https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/streaming-improve-page-performance/

Although this is benefial for _most_ sites, and is a sane default for Astro, HTML streaming has some caveats. Once Astro executes the frontmatter of the page component, the HTML response is streamed to the client _as it is rendered_. This means that when the frontmatter of components deep in the page is executed the response has already been partially sent. In the example below, when `MyComponent` is executed, the response has already been constructed and is being streamed.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent.astro';
---

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Example</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<MyComponent />
	</body>
</html>
```

This prevents components from changing the status code of the response and from completely switching the response under some condition. For that reason, calling `endRequest` from a component _in_ the page is not allowed, just like returning a response:

```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro"
---
import { endRequest } from '@it-astro/cut-short';

// Neither of these is allowed
endRequest(new Response('Page not found', { status: 404 }));
return new Response('Page not found', { status: 404 });
---
```

This is not only limited to returning a response. Other features for on-demand rendering are also restricted to the frontmatter of the page and unavailable for any other component, such as:
- Setting response headers using `Astro.response.headers`
- Setting the page status using `Astro.response.status`
- Setting cookies using `Astro.cookies`
- Redirecting to a different page using `return Astro.redirect()`
- Rewriting the page as a different page using `return Astro.rewrite()`
- Showing the 500 error page when an error is thrown from a component

Angelika Cathor wrote a [great summary](https://angelika.me/2025/03/16/implications-of-astro-html-streaming/) of those limitations and caveats, along with a few others external to Astro like SEO and instrumentation[^1]. I am not well-versed in SEO, so I don't know what are the impacts it can have. 

[^1]: The Sentry limitation ws a bug on the integration and not a streaming limitation. Integrations can detect errors thrown from components even with streaming enabled, they just can't change the page status based on the error. This bug was fixed on https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15995
