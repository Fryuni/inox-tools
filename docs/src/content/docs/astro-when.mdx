packageName: '@inox-tools/astro-when'
description: Know when and where your code is running in your Astro project
---

This integration provides an import that exposes when in the lifecycle of an Astro codebase your code is running.

When/Where your code is running is made available as an exported constant, so you can change even the exported values of your modules based on it.

## Installing the integration

This integration is needed during build time only, so you can install it as a dev dependency.

import InstallCmd from '@/components/InstallCmd.astro';

<InstallCmd />

## How to use

Anywhere in your code, be it on a TypeScript file, an Astro component, an MDX file or any UI framework file, you can an import from `@it-astro:when`. This module exports the following:

- An enum `When` defining the constant for each scenario your code might be running.
- A constant `whenAmI`, which is a value of type `When`.

The possible values are:

- `When.Client`: When your code is running on the client side.
- `When.Server`: When your code is running on a prod server serving an SSR route.
- `When.Prerender`: When your code is running during build to prerendeer a route on a project outputing for an SSR runtime.
- `When.StaticBuild`: When your code is running during build to prerender a route on a project that is entirely static (no SSR adapter and `output: 'static'`).
- `When.DevServer`: When your code is running on the server during development.

:::note
`astro preview` is intended to behave as a prod server, so instead of exposing that as `When.PreviewServer` it is intentionally exposed as `When.Server`.

## Example

The following code demonstrate how to exposes a different [Astro middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/) depending on when the code is running:

```ts
import { whenAmI, When } from '@it-astro:when';
import type { MiddlewareHandler } from 'astro';

const middlewares: Record<When, MiddlewareHandler> = {
	[When.Client]: () => {
		throw new Error('Client should not run a middleware!');
	},
	[When.DevServer]: (_, next) => {
		console.log('Running middleware on dev server');
		return next();
	},
	[When.Server]: (_, next) => {
		console.log('Running middleware on server for a server route');
		return next();
	},
	[When.Prerender]: (_, next) => {
		console.log('Running middleware while prerendering a route during build for an SSR output');
		return next();
	},
	[When.StaticBuild]: (_, next) => {
		console.log(
			'Running middleware while rendering a route during build for a fully static output'
		);
		return next();
	},
};

export const onRequest = middlewares[whenAmI];
```

For a project using this integration, including the example middleware above, check [this example](https://github.com/Fryuni/inox-tools/tree/main/examples/astro-when). You can also see it in action on a deployment of that project [here](https://inox-tools-ex-astro-when.pages.dev/).
