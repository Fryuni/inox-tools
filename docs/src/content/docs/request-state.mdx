Astro provides [`Astro.locals`/`context.locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astrolocals) for shared state between different components being rendered in a page.

This state can only be accessed from an Astro component using the `Astro` constant or from middlewares from the context. Sharing state between framework components is not provided and inconvenient.

Framework components using the shared state won't have the same state on the client, resulting in problems with the server and the client rendering different contents.

This library provides a solution for that, any state set using this library is shared across any component (even from UI frameworks) used in rendering the page in both server and client side.

## Installing the dependency

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add @inox-tools/request-state" />

## How to use

Import the two functions anywhere in your code:

```ts
import { getState, setState } from '@it-astro:state';

setState('some key', 'some value');

const state = getState('some key');
```

The state can be any value supported by the [`devalue` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devalue) plus:

- `Date`s
- `URL`s
- Global symbols (`Symbol.for`)
- Well-known symbols (`Symbol.XXX`)

### `setState`

Params:

- `key` (`string`): The key of a value in the state
- `value` (`unknown`): The value to be set

### `getState`

Params:

- `key` (`string`): The key of a value in the state
- `valueIfMissing` (`unknown`): An optional value to set if there is no value in the state for the given key.

Returns the value of the state for the given key, if present. If now, sets the value to `valueIfMissing` and returns it.
