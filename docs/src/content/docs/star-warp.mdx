title: Star Warp
description: Warp-drive search for Astro sites using Pagefind
packageName: '@inox-tools/star-warp'
---

This integration adds a quick "jump to first search result" URL to any Astro site using Pagefind. With that, your users can search within your website from their browsers search bar directly.

## Installing the integration

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add @inox-tools/star-warp" />

## How to use

With the integration installed, navigating to `<your site>/warp?q=your search term` will navigate to the first result of that search.

For example, go to https://inox-tools.fryuni.dev/warp?q=logger and see where you land :)

This works completely statically, you don't need SSR to use this integration.

## Using with Starlight

This integration is also a Starlight plugin to get better defaults from your Starlight site!

Just move it from the `integrations` property on your `astro.config.mjs` to the `plugins` property in side the Starlight integration:

```ts title="astro.config.mjs" del={9} ins={7}
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
import starWarp from '@inox-tools/star-warp';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			plugins: [starWarp()],
		}),
		starWarp(),
	],
});
```
