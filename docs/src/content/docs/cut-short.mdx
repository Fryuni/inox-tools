title: Cut-Short Requests
---

Cut-short is an Astro integration that lets you stop processing a request instantly and send back a custom response, simplifying control flow in your Astro applications. By introducing the `endRequest` function, it eliminates the need for cumbersome workarounds like bubbling up response objects, throwing and catching sentinel errors, implementing custom middleware logic or replicating error response logic across all your pages.

Keep the the custom response for specific conditions close to the conditions and have it shared across all your application. It's especially useful for scenarios like user authentication and access control, where you might need to redirect users to sign-in page from anywhere that requires authentication or to turn any page they don't have access to into a 404 to avoid information leak (like GitHub does).

## Installing the integration

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add @inox-tools/cut-short" />

## How to use

From any code that is reachable from a page rendering context can use the `endRequest` function to stop the.

A page-rendering context is when you are inside of:

- A middleware;
- The frontmatter of a page component (not components _in_ the page, see [streaming](#streaming));
- An API endpoint;
- A function called from another page-rendering context.

```ts title="src/pages/userId.ts" del={3-4} ins={7-8,18-19} {10-11}
import { endRequest } from '@it-astro/cut-short';

// This is invalid, the top level of a module is not a page rendering context.
endRequest(new Response('Page not found', { status: 404 }));

export const GET = () => {
	// This is valid, an API endpoint is a page rendering context.
	if (someCondition) endRequest(new Response('Matched inline blocking condition'));

  // Calling a function from a rendering context allows it to stop the request.
  const user = getUser();

	// The normal response
	return new Response(user.id);
};

export function getUser() {
  // This is valid, this function is called from a page rendering context.
  if (noUser) endRequest(new Response('No user', { status: 401 }));

  return {...};
}
```

```astro title="src/pages/dashboard.astro" ins={4-5}
---
import { getUser } from './userId.js';

// Calling a function from a rendering context allows it to stop the request.
const user = getUser();
---

<Dashboard />
```

### `endRequest()`

**Type:** `(withResponse: Response | (() => Response | Promise<Response>)) => void`

Stop the current request and send back a custom response.

The argument can be a `Response` object to be used directly or a function that returns a `Response` object or a promise that resolves to a `Response`.

## Streaming

Once Astro executes the frontmatter of the page component, the HTML response is streamed to the client _as it is rendered_. This means that when the frontmatter of components deep in the page is executed the response has already been partially sent. In the example below, when `MyComponent` is executed, the response has already been constructed and is being streamed.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent.astro';
---

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Example</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<MyComponent />
	</body>
</html>
```

This prevents components from changing the status code of the response and from completely switching the response under some condition. For that reason, calling `endRequest` from a component _in_ the page is not allowed, just like returning a response:

```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro"
---
import { endRequest } from '@it-astro/cut-short';

// Neither of these is allowed
endRequest(new Response('Page not found', { status: 404 }));
return new Response('Page not found', { status: 404 });
---
```
